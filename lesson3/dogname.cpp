/*

For this practice project, there are 2 options
1 --> directly declare an array with dog names
2 --> read dog names from txt file with for loop and append to array

*/

//1: We need to include iostream to be able to cin cout
#include <iostream>

//2: We always need to use namespace std
using namespace std;

//the int main is the so called main function, when running code it is called first.
int main()
{ 



















































































string dognames[100] = {};
