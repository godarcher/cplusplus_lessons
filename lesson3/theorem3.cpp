//1: We need to include iostream to be able to work with files
#include <iostream>

//2: We always need to use namespace std
using namespace std;

//the int main is the so called main function, when running code it is called first.
int main()
{ 

//First lets start talking about the for loop again
//the for loop can be used for two purposes
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    string example = "reached";
}


//what does this say?
int i = 0;
if (i < 10)
{
    string example = "reached";
}
i++;

//then 

int i = 1;
if (i < 10)
{
    string example = "reached";
}
i++;

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{

}
//i < 10 holds for, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
//so the for loop will be ran 10 times, we can use i inside the for loop as a counter

//now lets rewind how arrays work

//arrays :)
int grades[10000];
int grades[10] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};

//lets say i have 500 classmates
string classmates[500] = {};

for (int i = 0; i++; i < size(classmates))
{
    classmates[i] = "name";
}

string dognames[20] = {};

//handy tips for intendation
//tab for to the right (well known)
//shift tab for reverse (not well known)
